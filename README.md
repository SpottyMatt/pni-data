NOTE: This is still a work in progress. Please report any bugs or errors in the underlying data.

The data for week 51 of the 2019-2020 flu season (week 51 of 2019) appears to be erronous. There is a steep spike across all weeks that goes away in the next week. It was been removed from this analysis for clarify. If an updated report comes out I will add it back in.

This is the project used to collect the data and create the visualization show here:
